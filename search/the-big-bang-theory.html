   <h1>The big bang theory</h1>
  </div>

      <p>The Big Bang is a theory that explains how the universe began and how it has been changing over time. According to this theory, the universe started about 13.8 billion years ago from an extremely hot, dense state and has been expanding ever since.</p>
   <p>At the very beginning, all matter, energy, space, and even time itself were compressed into a tiny point. This was not an explosion in space, but an expansion of space itself. As space expanded, the universe cooled. In the first fractions of a second, fundamental particles such as quarks and electrons formed. Soon after, quarks combined to make protons and neutrons.</p>
    <p>Within the first few minutes, these protons and neutrons joined together to form the nuclei of simple atoms, mainly hydrogen and helium. However, the universe was still too hot for electrons to attach to these nuclei. About 380,000 years later, the universe cooled enough for atoms to form. This allowed light to travel freely through space for the first time. That ancient light is still detectable today as the cosmic microwave background radiation, one of the strongest pieces of evidence for the Big Bang.</p>
    <p> Over millions of years, gravity caused slightly denser regions of matter to pull in more material. These regions grew into stars, galaxies, and galaxy clusters. Inside stars, nuclear fusion created heavier elements such as carbon, oxygen, and iron, which were later spread through space by supernova explosions. These elements eventually became the building blocks of planets and life.</p>
    <p> The universe is still expanding today. Observations show that distant galaxies are moving away from us, and the farther they are, the faster they recede. This ongoing expansion supports the Big Bang theory and helps scientists understand the past, present, and future of the universe. But there is another theory - the expanding universe theory. </p>
