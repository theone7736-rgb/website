Allmost everyone thinks that our universe was made from the big bang theory, but is that true? Mabye not. Today I will share key information from all the top theories: the iconic big bang theory, the stable universe theory, the simulation theory and the unknown theory so that you can make your own conclusion to which one it true.

### The big bang theory
The Big Bang is a theory that explains how the universe began and how it has been changing over time. According to this theory, the universe started about 13.8 billion years ago from an extremely hot, dense state and has been expanding ever since.
At the very beginning, all matter, energy, space, and even time itself were compressed into a tiny point. This was not an explosion in space, but an expansion of space itself. As space expanded, the universe cooled. In the first fractions of a second, fundamental particles such as quarks and electrons formed. Soon after, quarks combined to make protons and neutrons.
Within the first few minutes, these protons and neutrons joined together to form the nuclei of simple atoms, mainly hydrogen and helium. However, the universe was still too hot for electrons to attach to these nuclei. About 380,000 years later, the universe cooled enough for atoms to form. This allowed light to travel freely through space for the first time. That ancient light is still detectable today as the cosmic microwave background radiation, one of the strongest pieces of evidence for the Big Bang.
Over millions of years, gravity caused slightly denser regions of matter to pull in more material. These regions grew into stars, galaxies, and galaxy clusters. Inside stars, nuclear fusion created heavier elements such as carbon, oxygen, and iron, which were later spread through space by supernova explosions. These elements eventually became the building blocks of planets and life.
The universe is still expanding today. Observations show that distant galaxies are moving away from us, and the farther they are, the faster they recede. This ongoing expansion supports the Big Bang theory and helps scientists understand the past, present, and future of the universe. But there is another theory - the expanding universe theory.

### The expanding universe theory
The expanding universe theory explains how the universe is continuously growing larger as space itself stretches over time. Rather than galaxies simply moving through space, this theory states that space between galaxies is increasing, causing them to move farther apart.
The idea began with observations made in the early 20th century. Astronomers, most notably Edwin Hubble, discovered that light from distant galaxies is redshifted. This redshift means the light waves are stretched, which shows that those galaxies are moving away from us. The farther a galaxy is, the faster it appears to be receding, a relationship now known as Hubble’s Law. This observation provided strong evidence that the universe is expanding uniformly in all directions.
As the universe expands, distances between large structures such as galaxy clusters increase, while smaller systems like galaxies, solar systems, and atoms remain held together by gravity or other fundamental forces. This means expansion does not cause planets or people to stretch, but instead affects the vast spaces between galaxies.
In the late 20th century, scientists discovered that the expansion of the universe is not slowing down, but accelerating. This unexpected acceleration is attributed to a mysterious force called dark energy, which makes up a large portion of the universe and counteracts gravity on cosmic scales.
The expanding universe theory also allows scientists to look back in time. Because light takes time to travel, observing distant galaxies shows the universe as it was billions of years ago. This helps astronomers understand how galaxies formed and evolved as the universe grew larger. But there are still 2 more theories, next, the simulation theory.

### The simulation theory
The simulation theory proposes that reality, as we experience it, may be an artificial construct, similar to a highly advanced computer simulation, rather than a fundamentally “base” physical world. According to this idea, the universe, its laws of physics, and even conscious beings could be generated and maintained by an underlying computational system far more advanced than any technology humans currently possess.
At the core of simulation theory is the observation that the universe behaves in mathematically precise ways. Physical reality appears to run on clear rules, constants, and limits, much like a programmed system. Concepts such as quantized energy, maximum speeds (like the speed of light), and discrete units of information in physics are sometimes compared to pixels, clock rates, or processing limits in computer systems. From this perspective, space and time may function like the framework of a simulation rather than an independent, absolute backdrop.
Consciousness plays a central role in the theory. If reality is simulated, conscious minds may be the “users” or “agents” within the system. Some interpretations suggest that consciousness is not fully generated by the simulation, but instead interfaces with it, similar to how a player experiences a virtual world through an avatar. Others argue that consciousness itself could be an emergent property produced by sufficiently complex information processing.
Within this framework, sleep and dreaming can be viewed as a form of internal optimization, similar to machine learning processes. In modern artificial intelligence, systems improve by reviewing data, reinforcing useful patterns, and discarding noise, often during offline or background training phases. Likewise, when humans sleep, the brain reduces input from the external world and focuses inward. During dreaming, it replays experiences, forms new associations, strengthens neural connections, and tests scenarios without real-world consequences. From a simulation-theory perspective, this resembles a local “training cycle,” where each conscious agent refines its internal model of reality to function more effectively within the system.
However, simulation theory places far more emphasis on the structure of reality as a whole than on sleep alone. The theory also addresses probability and randomness. Events that appear random may be the result of underlying algorithms or computational shortcuts, similar to pseudo-random number generation. The fact that reality is only ever observed at the level required by an observer has been compared to rendering on demand, where a system only computes detail when it is needed.
Another key aspect is efficiency. Simulations are designed to conserve resources. This idea is sometimes used to interpret why the universe has limits, why vast regions of space are mostly empty, and why physical laws are consistent and reusable across the cosmos. Complex detail exists where observers are present, while unobserved regions may only exist in a simplified or probabilistic state until measured.
Simulation theory also raises philosophical questions about meaning and free will. If reality is simulated, choices may still be meaningful within the system, even if the system itself is designed. Just as characters in a game can make real decisions within programmed boundaries, conscious beings may possess genuine agency despite existing in a constructed environment.

### The unknown theory
The theory that we do not yet know enough suggests that humanity’s understanding of the universe is deeply limited, and that what our satellites, telescopes, and instruments observe may represent only a small internal region of a much larger reality, possibly just the “inside” of our universe’s local environment, with Earth embedded within it.
According to this perspective, modern astronomy does not show the universe as it truly is, but only as it appears from within our observational boundaries. Satellites such as space telescopes detect light, radiation, and particles that reach Earth, but they are restricted by distance, time, and physical limits like the speed of light. This means we can only see as far as light has had time to travel since the universe became transparent. Beyond that boundary, reality may exist in forms we cannot yet detect or even properly imagine.
From this viewpoint, satellites may be analogous to probes inside a vast system, only capable of mapping nearby terrain. What appears to be the “edge” of the universe could simply be the limit of what information can reach us, not a true boundary. The cosmic background radiation, for example, may be interpreted not as the aftermath of a beginning, but as a surface or internal horizon, a boundary within our universe’s environment that blocks information from deeper or outer layers.
This theory also emphasizes humility in science. Many of the universe’s most important components, such as dark matter, dark energy, and the nature of spacetime itself, are still poorly understood or entirely unknown. If most of the universe is made of things we cannot directly observe, then it is possible that entire structures or dimensions also exist beyond current detection methods.
Importantly, this idea does not reject science; instead, it highlights its incompleteness. Our models work extremely well within their tested range, but that range may be very small compared to the total structure of reality. Just as early ocean explorers mapped coastlines before understanding the full planet, humanity may currently be charting only the inner surface of a far larger cosmic system.

So wich theory do you think? The Big Bang theory, the Expanding universe theory, the Sinulation theory and the Unknown theory. If you're still unsure, you're not alone. Scirntists all over the wourld are trying to find the answer, but currently, we don't know.<
