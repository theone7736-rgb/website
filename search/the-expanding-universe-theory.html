  <p> The expanding universe theory explains how the universe is continuously growing larger as space itself stretches over time. Rather than galaxies simply moving through space, this theory states that space between galaxies is increasing, causing them to move farther apart. </p>
    <p>The idea began with observations made in the early 20th century. Astronomers, most notably Edwin Hubble, discovered that light from distant galaxies is redshifted. This redshift means the light waves are stretched, which shows that those galaxies are moving away from us. The farther a galaxy is, the faster it appears to be receding, a relationship now known as Hubble’s Law. This observation provided strong evidence that the universe is expanding uniformly in all directions.</p>
    <p> As the universe expands, distances between large structures such as galaxy clusters increase, while smaller systems like galaxies, solar systems, and atoms remain held together by gravity or other fundamental forces. This means expansion does not cause planets or people to stretch, but instead affects the vast spaces between galaxies.</p>
    <p> In the late 20th century, scientists discovered that the expansion of the universe is not slowing down, but accelerating. This unexpected acceleration is attributed to a mysterious force called dark energy, which makes up a large portion of the universe and counteracts gravity on cosmic scales.</p>
    <p>The expanding universe theory also allows scientists to look back in time. Because light takes time to travel, observing distant galaxies shows the universe as it was billions of years ago. This helps astronomers understand how galaxies formed and evolved as the universe grew larger. But there are still 2 more theories, next, the simulation theory.</p>
