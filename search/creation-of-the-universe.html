   <h1>The creation of the universe</h1>
  </div>
  <p>  Allmost everyone thinks that our universe was made from the big bang theory, but is that true? Mabye not. Today I will share key information from all the top theories: the iconic big bang theory, the stable universe theory, the simulation theory and the unknown theory so that you can make your own conclusion to which one it true.</p>
 <h2> The big bang theory </h2>
    <p>The Big Bang is a theory that explains how the universe began and how it has been changing over time. According to this theory, the universe started about 13.8 billion years ago from an extremely hot, dense state and has been expanding ever since.</p>
   <p>At the very beginning, all matter, energy, space, and even time itself were compressed into a tiny point. This was not an explosion in space, but an expansion of space itself. As space expanded, the universe cooled. In the first fractions of a second, fundamental particles such as quarks and electrons formed. Soon after, quarks combined to make protons and neutrons.</p>
    <p>Within the first few minutes, these protons and neutrons joined together to form the nuclei of simple atoms, mainly hydrogen and helium. However, the universe was still too hot for electrons to attach to these nuclei. About 380,000 years later, the universe cooled enough for atoms to form. This allowed light to travel freely through space for the first time. That ancient light is still detectable today as the cosmic microwave background radiation, one of the strongest pieces of evidence for the Big Bang.</p>
    <p> Over millions of years, gravity caused slightly denser regions of matter to pull in more material. These regions grew into stars, galaxies, and galaxy clusters. Inside stars, nuclear fusion created heavier elements such as carbon, oxygen, and iron, which were later spread through space by supernova explosions. These elements eventually became the building blocks of planets and life.</p>
    <p> The universe is still expanding today. Observations show that distant galaxies are moving away from us, and the farther they are, the faster they recede. This ongoing expansion supports the Big Bang theory and helps scientists understand the past, present, and future of the universe. But there is another theory - the expanding universe theory. </p>
    <h2> The expanding universe theory </h2>
    <p> The expanding universe theory explains how the universe is continuously growing larger as space itself stretches over time. Rather than galaxies simply moving through space, this theory states that space between galaxies is increasing, causing them to move farther apart. </p>
    <p>The idea began with observations made in the early 20th century. Astronomers, most notably Edwin Hubble, discovered that light from distant galaxies is redshifted. This redshift means the light waves are stretched, which shows that those galaxies are moving away from us. The farther a galaxy is, the faster it appears to be receding, a relationship now known as Hubble’s Law. This observation provided strong evidence that the universe is expanding uniformly in all directions.</p>
    <p> As the universe expands, distances between large structures such as galaxy clusters increase, while smaller systems like galaxies, solar systems, and atoms remain held together by gravity or other fundamental forces. This means expansion does not cause planets or people to stretch, but instead affects the vast spaces between galaxies.</p>
    <p> In the late 20th century, scientists discovered that the expansion of the universe is not slowing down, but accelerating. This unexpected acceleration is attributed to a mysterious force called dark energy, which makes up a large portion of the universe and counteracts gravity on cosmic scales.</p>
    <p>The expanding universe theory also allows scientists to look back in time. Because light takes time to travel, observing distant galaxies shows the universe as it was billions of years ago. This helps astronomers understand how galaxies formed and evolved as the universe grew larger. But there are still 2 more theories, next, the simulation theory.</p>
